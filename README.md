# Fake-News-Detection-XGBoost
This project tackles the challenge of classifying news articles as real or fake using a supervised machine learning pipeline built in Python. The system leverages natural language processing (NLP) techniques for feature engineering and uses an optimized XGBoost classifier to detect misleading content with high accuracy.
